    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat with a bit of olive oil. Add
        chopped onion and cook until soft (2–3 minutes). Add garlic and cook 30
        seconds. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat. Stir
        in marinara sauce, tomato paste (if using), oregano, basil, salt, and
        pepper. Simmer on low for 10–15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix ricotta, egg, Parmesan, 1 cup of mozzarella, salt, and
        pepper until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish: Spread a thin
        layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer 3 noodles over the sauce.
        Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture. Add a layer of meat sauce. Repeat
        steps for 2 more layers. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with foil (spray foil with non-stick spray so it doesn't stick to
        the cheese). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional
        20 minutes until bubbly and golden. Let rest for 10–15 minutes before
        slicing.
